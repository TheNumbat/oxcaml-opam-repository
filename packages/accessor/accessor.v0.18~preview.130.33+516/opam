synopsis:
  "A library that makes it nicer to work with nested functional data structures"
description: """
An accessor is a value that understands how to reach data within a larger data structure,
independently from what you intend to do with it. Accessors allow you to read and write
data and perform possibly-monadic traversals. By composing accessors, you can work with
increasingly complex data structures.

In case you have ever heard of "lenses", this is an OCaml implementation of that idea.
