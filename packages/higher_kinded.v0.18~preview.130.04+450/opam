synopsis: "A library with an encoding of higher kinded types in OCaml"
description: "
OCaml natively supports parameterized type constructors, such as =option=. The parameters
of a type constructor may only be types, not arbitrary type constructors. This library
makes it possible to parameterize a type with a witness that represents a type
constructor.
